The Growing Need for HashiCorp Vault Alternatives
If you’re managing secrets—think API keys, encryption keys, database credentials—you’ve probably run into HashiCorp Vault. It’s a powerful tool, but let’s be honest: it can be a nightmare to set up and maintain. Between its steep learning curve, high operational costs, and scaling challenges, many teams are actively searching for HashiCorp Vault alternatives that are simpler, more cost-effective, and excel in secret management.

One standout alternative? Akeyless. This Vaultless® SaaS platform offers a radically different approach to secrets management, cutting through the complexity while delivering robust security features. In this post, we’ll break down Vault’s limitations, why teams are switching, and why Akeyless is emerging as a top pick.

What is HashiCorp Vault and Its Limitations?
HashiCorp Vault at a Glance
HashiCorp Vault is a well-known secrets management solution that helps organizations secure sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, encryption keys, and more.

Vault has three main components:

1. Secrets Engines
It provides essential secrets management features, including:

Static Secrets: You can store any arbitrary secret using the Key/Value secrets engine.
Dynamic Secrets: Generates temporary credentials for databases and cloud platforms in addition to managing public key infrastructure (PKI).
Encryption-as-a-Service: Secures sensitive data with built-in encryption capabilities using the transit secrets engine. You can send vault any plaintext and get back cipher text. Vault also maintains the life cycle of the encryption keys which enhances data protection and compliance.
2. Authentication Methods
To retrieve secrets from Vault, you first need to authenticate into it. Vault offers many authentication methods, which can easily be categorized into human or machine authentication methods.

3. Policies
Policies are the authorization mechanism that allows certain operations in Vault. When a human or machine authenticates into Vault, they get a token back with specific policies attached. These policies allow access to certain paths in Vault with particular capabilities.

While Vault is undoubtedly powerful, it’s not without significant pain points.

Key Limitations of HashiCorp Vault
1. Complex Setup & High Maintenance
Vault Enterprise (the self-hosted version) is notoriously difficult to set up and maintain. I know because I’ve set up a few for my clients over the years. Some clients have opted to use HCP Vault (the SaaS version). However, that comes with security risks that you would need to evaluate for your own organization. Here is what I mean:

With HCP Vault, HashiCorp manages the infrastructure and encryption processes, meaning you are relying on them to keep your secrets secure. Since it operates on HashiCorp’s AWS environment, your secrets are ultimately stored in a third-party cloud, which raises concerns about:

Data Sovereignty: Your organization does not have full control over where and how secrets are stored.
Regulatory Compliance: Industries with strict compliance requirements (finance, healthcare, government) may face challenges ensuring full ownership of encryption keys.
Potential Third-Party Access: Since HashiCorp controls the infrastructure, there is a theoretical risk that they (or a government entity via subpoena) could gain access to sensitive data.
If these risks are a concern, Akeyless offers a true zero-trust model with Distributed Fragments Cryptography (DFC), ensuring that no third party—including Akeyless—can ever access your secrets.

Moreover, managing policies, authentication tokens, and access controls requires deep expertise and a well-thought-out plan.

2. High Cost & Scalability Challenges
Scaling HashiCorp Vault comes at a steep price. This includes the hardware cost for additional clusters and a hefty licensing cost.

3. Limited Automated Secret Rotation
When you create dynamic secrets in Vault, you need to create a root account on the system you are connecting Vault to. This allows Vault to create secrets on that system. This system can be a database or a cloud account like AWS. Vault allows you to rotate that secret so that no human can see it after the initial setup. This is good. However, this is done manually, and you can’t schedule or automate the rotation.

These challenges drive teams to search for more streamlined HashiCorp Vault alternatives.

Why Look for a HashiCorp Vault Alternative?
If you’re considering a Vault alternative, chances are you’ve encountered one (or more) of these frustrations:

1. Steep Learning Curve & Operational Overhead
Vault demands a deep technical understanding to configure policies, manage identities, and ensure secure deployments.

2. Costly Scaling Issues
Scaling HashiCorp Vault compels organizations to invest in expensive infrastructure or risk downtime and performance degradation. As your Vault deployment expands across different regions, additional clusters become necessary, each incurring further licensing and hardware expenses. This is essential to enable Disaster Recovery and Performance Replication across these clusters.

3. Hidden Costs of Enterprise Features
The Vault Enterprise version unlocks key security features but at a high licensing cost. Some alternatives provide secure access and automated secrets management at a lower price.

Now that we’ve covered Vault’s challenges let’s explore Akeyless and why it’s quickly becoming the go-to secrets management tool.
