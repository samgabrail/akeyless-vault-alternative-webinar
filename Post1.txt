Why Consider an Alternative to HashiCorp Vault?
Akeyless vs. HashiCorp Vault
While HashiCorp Vault has been celebrated for its security features, its evolution from a self-hosted solution (enterprise version) to a SaaS offering (HCP Vault) unveils limitations, notably in cost scalability and operational intricacy. The expansion to manage increasing secrets volumes and ensure high availability introduces a cost model that doesn’t favor scaling, presenting a significant challenge for organizations aiming to manage expenses efficiently without compromising security.

Moreover, Vault’s complex setup and management — involving intricate policies, entities, identities, and more — demand substantial time and dedicated resources. This complexity can detract from the agility and innovation businesses seek in a digital-first environment. Now, Akeyless, born in the cloud and crafted as a SaaS-first solution, stands out as a next-generation alternative designed to navigate and streamline the secrets management landscape quickly and efficiently.

Akeyless goes beyond traditional boundaries with its Distributed Fragments Cryptography (DFC) for enhanced security, FIPS 140-2 certification, and a scalable architecture that minimizes hardware dependency. This pivot to Akeyless represents a strategic move towards a solution that prioritizes operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and security, tailor-made for the dynamic needs of growing businesses.

While HashiCorp Vault boasts a robust set of security features, organizations seeking external support and enterprise features may find Akeyless comprehensive service and support model more aligned with their needs.

Overview of Akeyless
Overview of Akeyless
Akeyless is revolutionizing secrets management with its Vaultless® SaaS platform, offering a seamless, scalable solution for modern digital environments. Moving away from traditional vault-based architectures, Akeyless introduces a more adaptable and streamlined approach to managing digital secrets. This cloud-native solution simplifies the integration and management of secrets across diverse environments, from entirely cloud-based to complex hybrid systems, significantly reducing the operational overhead linked to physical infrastructures.

The main concern I had when I heard of Akeyless as a secrets management solution offered as a SaaS was privacy. There was no way I would store an organization’s secrets under management by a cloud vendor That’s when I learned about Akeyless Distributed Fragments Cryptography (DFC) patented technology.

DFC ensures that secrets are never fully assembled in any location, not even within Akeyless’s infrastructure. Instead, a customer fragment remains within the user’s control, guaranteeing that no organization, cloud service provider, government agency, or Akeyless can access your secrets. This unique approach enhances security and reinforces trust in Akeyless’s commitment to data protection, setting a new standard for SaaS secrets management solutions.

High-Level Comparison between HashiCorp Vault and Akeyless
Choosing between HashiCorp Vault and Akeyless is critical for organizations prioritizing efficient, secure secrets management. Drawing from over six years of my experience with Vault, it’s clear that while it offers robust capabilities, the steep adoption curve can pose challenges, especially for teams seeking agility and simplicity. As we delve into this comparison, it’s essential to understand why Akeyless shines as one of the most efficient HashiCorp Vault alternatives, especially when considering ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.

Ease of Use and Adoption: Akeyless stands out for its intuitive user experience and straightforward setup process, making it easy to get started. Unlike the intricate setup and deep understanding required for Vault’s policies, entities, and group hierarchies, Akeyless simplifies access roles, making secrets management accessible to teams of all skill levels. The platform’s design removes the complexities associated with identity and permissions management, which can often become overwhelming in Vault, especially for beginners. While Akeyless also employs advanced security measures like DFC for unparalleled secure access to sensitive data, it emphasizes a user-friendly approach, ensuring teams can adopt and scale their secrets management efforts without the headache.

Unique Akeyless Features
Akeyless not only enhances secure access to your systems but also manages API keys, encryption keys, and sensitive data with a level of efficiency and security unmatched by traditional solutions. Now let’s take a look at some of the unique features that Akeyless has that are not currently available in HashiCorp Vault.

1. Automated Rotated Secrets
Akeyless automates the rotation of secrets, ensuring that keys and credentials are regularly updated without manual intervention, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. This is different from dynamic secrets. We’re talking about automating the rotation of Akeyless credentials to connect to external services such as AWS, GCP, Azure, or Databases such as Oracle, MySQL, etc. The key here is the automation. HashiCorp Vault can rotate such credentials, but it’s a manual process every time.

2. RDP, Docker Hub, Ping Client for Dynamic Just-in-Time Secrets
Akeyless supports dynamic secrets for RDP, Docker Hub, and Ping Client, among others. This facilitates secure, temporary access that minimizes the risk of secret exposure. Dynamic secrets have become essential in today’s world. We should no longer rely on static, long-lived secrets.

4. Secrets Sharing
Akeyless enables easy and secure secret sharing across teams, ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

5. Universal Identity (UID)
Addressing the secret zero problem challenge, Akeyless’s Universal Identity feature ensures secure access to secrets in on-prem environments. This is one of my favorite features. HashiCorp Vault’s solution to the secret zero problem for on-prem environments is to use the AppRole authentication method alongside the Vault agent. This approach has multiple issues with delivering the role ID and secret ID to the Vault agent. The secret ID is token-bound and has a time-to-live. The vault operator needs to find a way to deliver a new secret ID to the vault agent regularly. This is necessary in case the vault agent restarts for whatever reason.

The Akeyless UID authentication method lets you identify your machines without an initial secret. This authentication method effectively solves the secret zero problem by providing an inherited identity derived from the parent system and an ephemeral token for continuous authentication. The following diagram illustrates the flow of credentials when using UID tokens, demonstrating the elimination of the secret zero problem.

Universal Identity Workflow
The authentication process has an initial phase where the administrator creates the original authentication method. The UID is repeatedly rotated to avoid the secret zero problem until the original credentials become unusable. Constant rotation helps protect against any vulnerability.

6. Password Manager Mobile App and Chrome/Firefox Extension
With its mobile app and browser extensions, Akeyless offers convenient secrets management and autofill capabilities for end-users, enhancing productivity without compromising security. This tool allows for the secure storage management and sharing of personal passwords within a private folder that is inaccessible even to vault admins, ensuring your corporate secrets remain confidential and secure.
