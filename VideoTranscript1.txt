0:00
if you've known me for any length of
0:01
time you'll know how much I like Hashi
0:04
Corb Vault however recently I started to
0:07
look into Aus and I'm quite impressed by
0:09
what it has to offer in my opinion
0:12
achillus is the top alternative today to
0:15
Hash cor vault in this video I'll walk
0:17
you through 10 unique achillus features
0:20
that are not found in hash cor Vault my
0:23
name is Sam Gabriel and let's get
0:24
started first up is the idea of
1. Automated Rotated Secrets
0:27
automating rotated secrets and rotated
0:30
Secrets is a concept not available in
0:33
hasher Corp Fall explicitly and the idea
0:36
here is that this is the secret that
0:37
aulus uses to connect to an external
0:41
third-party service so if you go to new
0:44
and look for rotated secret you'll see
0:47
that there are a number of databases
0:49
that ailles can connect to Cassandra
0:51
redis red shift snowflake clouds your
0:55
three major clouds operating systems
0:57
infrastructure like Docker hub ldap or
1:00
web so once you have this connection in
1:03
place you can rotate this secret so if I
1:06
look at the Azure rotated secret here
1:09
for example here's my credentials client
1:13
ID tenant ID client secret and so on and
1:16
now what I can do is I can manually
1:19
rotate this
1:20
secret which hasore for the most part
1:22
can do as well in terms of its
1:24
connection to that third party but uh
1:27
more than that you can hear in a keyless
1:30
use an automation mechanism where you
1:33
can rotate the secret on an interval
1:36
base so you can see here I'm rotating
1:38
every 90 days you can change that as
1:41
well every 90 days at 10:00 is what I'm
1:43
doing here or you can do manual only
1:46
right this is really key because we're
1:48
trying to make sure that we don't have
1:50
any kind of long lived credentials of
1:53
any kind even the ones that achillus has
1:55
to those external third party systems so
1:59
automated rotate Secrets is really key
2:01
here continuing our conversation around
2. RDP, Docker Hub, Ping Client - Dynamic Secrets
2:04
short-lived credentials Dynamic secrets
2:08
are key right and of course hasor Vault
2:11
has a bunch of dynamic Secrets Aus as
2:13
well but the more I find connections
2:17
into third party systems to create these
2:19
Dynamic Secrets the the better off we
2:22
all are and I can see here there are
2:24
quite a bit of dynamic secrets that
2:26
ailles has RDP dockerhub pink clim stand
2:30
out as three that are not available in
2:33
hash cor Vault I'm quite impressed with
2:36
the actual achillus UI and how easy it
2:38
is to create things just with the UI as
2:41
you can see here now of course it's not
2:43
my preferred way of using any kind of
2:47
software you always want to use
2:49
infrastructure code and Aus of course
2:51
has a terraform provider that you can
2:54
use but just know that the more we see
2:57
Dynamic Secrets such as RDP as we see
3:01
here we've got a ping client I see
3:04
artifactory Chef infra dockerhub and so
3:07
on the better off we are because again
3:10
we don't want any longlived credentials
3:13
in our environment third on our list is
3. Custom Targets for Dynamic Secrets
3:15
custom targets and custom targets really
3:18
simplify resource and credential
3:21
management organizing endpoints in ayus
3:24
and eliminating manual credential
3:27
updates it really helps with operation
3:30
efficiency which is not available in
3:32
hash cor Vault but as you can see here
3:36
what you do is you create a Target and
3:39
there are multiple targets that we saw
3:41
before for the different third-party
3:43
systems that we have here so you create
3:45
the target ahead of time and once you
3:47
create the target then you can create
3:50
other items and if you see here this AWS
3:54
Target if I look at the associated items
3:56
I have a dynamic secret I have a
3:58
universal Secret connector I have
4:00
rotated secrets so once you've
4:03
identified this target now you can
4:05
associate these items with so from a
4:07
configuration perspective it makes
4:09
things much easier for me so you can see
4:12
Azure same thing I have a bunch of items
4:14
associated with it my postgress database
4:18
I probably don't have anything here just
4:20
yet but again if I want to create a
4:21
dynamic secret for example I can go to
4:24
items Dynamic
4:26
secret and let's say we said post so
4:31
postgress and then from here you can see
4:34
the target mode you can choose an
4:36
existing Target or you can explicitly
4:38
specify Target properties so it's easier
4:41
to just use an existing Target that can
4:44
be used over and over again for for
4:47
different things in this case I'm using
4:48
it in a dynamic secret for my database
4. Secrets Sharing
4:51
next we'll talk about secret sharing I
4:53
like this feature you can go into any of
4:55
the secrets that you have let's say this
4:58
static secret that I have here and at
5:00
the top you can click share and provide
5:04
you an email address of one of your
5:06
colleagues for
5:08
example and uh you can specify how long
5:11
you want the secret to be valid for so
5:13
let's say 1 hour uh you can also say one
5:16
time View and get a sharable link and
5:19
this link is available for the next 1
5:20
hour so if I open an incognito window
5:23
and copy this let's take a
5:27
look says someone shared an item with
5:29
you on a keyless platform to view it
5:31
please verify your email address let me
5:33
give it a wrong email address let just
5:36
to see what
5:41
happens a link to the secret has been
5:43
sent to your email let's check my email
5:46
real quick and nothing shows up in my
5:49
email so let's do this again with a
5:52
proper
5:58
email and now see an email and there's a
6:02
link in the email takes me to this
6:05
site and I can
6:08
view I can view this secret right
6:11
here and I don't see anything else in
6:14
Ailes so it was just that secret that
6:16
was shared with me so this is a really
6:18
really cool feature now let's take a
5. Universal Identity UID
6:21
look at my favorite feature in achilas
6:23
and this is the universal identity that
6:26
really solves that secret zero problem
6:28
that you might into for on Prem
6:31
deployments now Vault or hash cor
6:34
vault's solution to that is using appol
6:37
with a vault agent and I have a few
6:40
videos talking about that you can check
6:41
out but there are some issues with that
6:45
when it comes to rebooting the agent and
6:47
and stuff like that so ailis actually
6:49
solves this problem with universal
6:52
Identity or
6:53
uid so you can quickly look here if you
6:56
go under authentication users and off
6:58
methods click new Universal identity you
7:02
can go ahead and configure that um and
7:05
I'm probably going to have a separate
7:07
video talking about uid and giving a
7:09
demo but just know that this is the flow
7:12
and it's quite simple an admin creates a
7:15
new uid off method just like I just
7:17
showed in the previous screen through
7:19
the Aila SAS and then the Aila SAS will
7:23
respond with an acknowledgement of
7:24
course and then the admin generates this
7:28
initial uid D token we'll call it U
7:31
token and loads it in the
7:34
application and then this is the client
7:36
or the application in this case runs the
7:38
off command using that uid init token
7:41
that we started with the SAS responds
7:44
with a jot token we'll call it the T
7:46
token and then the client runs commands
7:49
using this T token and then you can see
7:51
here is a rotate uid token at some point
7:54
the client rotates this uid using that U
7:57
token and then it gets act plus A New U
8:01
token and then continues to run off
8:03
commands with this new U token and then
8:06
we keep rotating that initial token of
8:09
course gets rotated as we go along but
8:12
in case of a a reboot or something like
8:14
that that's not a problem we continue to
8:17
work seamlessly so once again I'll
8:19
create a video separately just talking
8:21
about uid but this is an excellent
8:23
feature excellent solution to that
8:25
secret zero problem for on premises
8:28
environments where the platform doesn't
8:30
give an identity to the resources that
8:32
it spins up something like VMware for
8:35
example doesn't give you an identity
8:37
whereas the clouds of course like AWS or
8:40
Azure gcp gives identities to the
8:43
resources that they spin up in number
6. Password Manager
8:46
six we have a password manager from Aus
8:50
and it has a mobile app for iOS you can
8:54
see on the screen here and there's one
8:56
for Android so that's that's really cool
9:00
they also have a Chrome extension an
9:03
edge extension and also a Firefox
9:06
extension so you can actually use this
9:09
as your personal password manager and
9:13
use your personal secrets in here that
9:15
will not be available to anybody else so
9:18
you can add new items I have my keyless
9:20
admin email password here as well I can
9:23
add favorites uh you can also access the
9:26
corporate secrets from here so if I go
9:28
back and look at my hello secret I can
9:30
view it directly
9:32
here in addition to that I can actually
9:36
for AWS I can launch if I show the value
9:39
here this will show me a temporary
9:43
Dynamic secret for accessing AWS with a
9:47
username and password also an access key
9:49
ID and a secret access key see it
9:51
expires in 3 hours I can also launch
9:55
this directly so what this will do it
9:57
will launch the AWS con
10:00
and log me in with those Dynamic
10:02
temporary credentials directly which is
10:04
pretty
10:06
neat as you can see here I'm logging in
10:09
to the AWS
10:10
console and if I look at the top here is
10:14
my temporary user temp. Sam Gabriel
10:19
teen8 so you can see that I'm already in
10:21
here with those credentials straight
10:23
from that password manager so it's a
10:25
really great addition that achillus has
10:27
and supported directly by achillus
7. Secure Remote Access
10:30
next is secure remote access which is
10:33
not available in Hashi cor vault as the
10:36
Vault product but it is available in
10:38
hash cor boundary and there is some
10:41
integration between of course boundary
10:44
and Vault but I like how this is a
10:46
license feature in achillus and pretty
10:50
much integrated in the achillus product
10:52
as a whole and as you can see here you
10:55
can expose different access to different
10:59
resources I have SSH to a couple of
11:02
resources postgress SQL I can directly
11:05
access a database RDP into a Windows
11:07
machine and also Azure portal so I can
11:12
quickly SSH into one of my target
11:15
machines here as this one and go in and
11:17
get a
11:20
CLI and I'm already connected here and
11:24
of course I can go into this dat
11:27
postgress database as well can connect
11:30
through with a web
11:39
portal and you kind of get the idea
11:46
here and now I'm in a Windows machine as
11:49
you can see so again it's great to see
11:51
secure mode access as part of the Achila
11:54
solution well integrated into the
11:57
product coming in at number eight is
8. Automatic Secrets Migration
12:00
automatic Secrets migration and achilas
12:03
does a great job in helping us to
12:05
migrate from other secret managers and
12:07
if you go into your gateway and go under
12:10
automatic migration there's a list of
12:12
different secret managers you can
12:14
migrate from into Aus here's AWS secret
12:18
manager for example if you click add you
12:21
can follow the instructions here pretty
12:23
simple and you can start migrating from
12:26
ads Secrets manager I had to write an
12:29
actual script a python script to migrate
12:32
from AWS secret manager over to hashr
12:35
Vault a while ago so it's nice to see
12:36
this already done for us in a kilus
12:39
there is of course active directory
12:41
Azure key Vault gcp Secrets manager
12:43
kubernetes secrets and hash cor vault as
12:46
well so if you want to migrate from hash
12:48
cor Vault you can go ahead and and do
12:51
that one password server in inventory
12:54
and so on so kilas did a really good job
12:57
in helping us to migrate from any of
13:00
these secrets managers over to
13:02
ailles next on our list is the universal
9. Universal Secrets Connector
13:05
Secrets connector think of it as a
13:08
manager of managers now you can have
13:11
keyless access multiple other Secrets
13:14
managers like AWS Secrets manager for
13:16
example and there are some use cases
13:19
where you have other teams that just
13:22
can't use Aus for example and they have
13:24
to use AWS Secrets manager so we can
13:28
still have a two-way sync between those
13:31
Secrets managers so what you can do is
13:34
you can go under items and new Universal
13:37
Secrets connector there is support for
13:39
AWS Azure gcp and kubernetes secrets so
13:43
AWS for example you select that and you
13:45
go through and apply the configuration I
13:49
already have something running so let's
13:50
go ahead and take a look under
13:55
AWS and view all secrets you see that I
13:58
already have two Secrets secret one and
14:01
two we can view secret one fuar secret
14:06
2 my secret and if I open my AWS
14:11
console I can also see the same thing
14:15
here
14:17
Fubar and secret 2 I've
14:21
got my secret and it is a two-way sync
14:25
so if I go ahead and decide to delete
14:27
secret 2 for example
14:41
that will show up that I've actually
14:43
deleted it I've deleted a secret from
14:45
AWS secret manager and it's reflected
14:48
here in Aus I can also create a new
14:51
secret let's call it secret
14:54
3 and let's give it a value of
15:04
let's give it a key value pair of
15:08
my new
15:12
secret save
15:16
that and now let's go to
15:20
AWS and already we see secret 3 show up
15:23
here retrieve secret value and my new
15:26
secret is available so we can see we
15:29
have a two-way sync between Achilles and
15:32
the other secret managers that it
15:33
supports which is great for some of
15:36
those use cases that I mentioned earlier
10. Reporting
15:39
finally we come to our last feature in
15:42
ailles and that is the reporting feature
15:45
I mentioned that I really like the
15:47
keyless UI and the team put a lot of
15:49
effort into the frontend UI and out of
15:52
the box Ailes gives you a lot of
15:55
analytics that you can see here that is
15:57
not available in hash cor vault you'd
15:59
have to send that to Splunk for example
16:01
or some other monitoring tool out of the
16:04
box you can see quite a lot of things in
16:06
Aus you still might want to send logs
16:08
over and metrics to some other system
16:12
that you might have for sure but out of
16:13
the box you can already see quite a lot
16:15
of things so analytics items you can see
16:18
total items we have here current request
16:21
location you can see in the last week
16:23
for example where the requests were
16:24
coming from requests by action type
16:27
let's see the last week we some of the
16:29
different requests that were coming
16:30
through request volume response time can
16:34
also look at certificates uh what
16:36
certificates are expired high risk
16:39
medium risk low risk healthy total
16:41
number of certificates in the
16:44
environment you can take a look at the
16:46
audit logs as well so I can see every
16:49
single audit log I can filter through
16:51
here and go in and take a closer look at
16:54
all my audit logs straight from the UI
16:58
what also love is the event center you
17:01
can go into open Event Center and you
17:04
can see all the different events that
17:06
have happened and I can filter here for
17:10
example and see certificates that are
17:12
about to expire and filter on that and
17:15
see this particular certificate that's
17:16
about to expire you can also see some of
17:19
your usage reports as well with some
17:22
pretty graphs so it's really nice to see
17:25
this available out of the box as we've
Wrap-Up
17:27
seen ayus is a compelling alternative to
17:30
Hash cor Vault with its SAS first
17:33
approach I encourage you to take a
17:35
closer look at Aus I have two videos one
17:37
is a general demo of all the achilas
17:40
features and the other one talks about
17:42
DFC which is their patented technology
17:44
that allows you to trust the SAS Secrets
17:47
manager I find it quite compelling thank
17:50
you for watching
